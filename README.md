Cupcake Challenge created by Cera Smart

WHAT THE PROJECT DOES

Here's how this game works:

Four clickable cupcakes are displayed on the page.

The player is shown a random target number at the start of round of the game.

When the player clicks on a cupcake, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The game does not disclose the cupcake's value until the player clicks a cupcake.
When the player clicks a cupcake, the player's score is updated in the points counter.
The player wins if their points matches the target number.

The player loses if their score exceeds the random number.

The game keeps track of wins and losses (as long as the browser window is not refreshed), and a new round begins whenever the player wins or loses.

When a new round begins again, the player sees a new random number, and all the cupcakes have four new hidden values. The user's points resets to 0.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

The game fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides working with creating random numbers and assigning them to elements, the assignment also taught me how to use modals in Bootstrap.
